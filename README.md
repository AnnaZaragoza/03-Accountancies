Keep track of your accountancies - editable tables that sum columns

![Alt Text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AnnaZaragoza/03-Accountancies/main/accountancies/gif/gif.gif)

# Description:
App created out of the need to check the amount of money my partner and I were putting on our sharing account, so far this year and the last 3.
As our excel licence expired, I decided to make the tables in HTML and CSS and do the operations in JS.
The app consists on 4 tables (from the year 2021 to the 2018) that show the standing order recived each month and by who, and calculate the total at the end of each column.
As the app was evolving, I decided to add the functionality of editing the cells (which is what I am working right now).

# Exercice to start practicing JS:
* Interactive table, highlighting where you are
* Sum columns function
* Slideshow / Carousel
* (In progress) Editable table with limit of characters
